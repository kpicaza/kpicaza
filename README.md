Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is [Koldo Picaza](https://github.com/sponsors/kpicaza),. I'm a self-taught PHP developer, working on different products since 2011.

#### ðŸ’¾ Software

I work as a **Software Crafter** at Codurance, and I love **doing** and **contributing to Open Source** in my free time.

I'm the creator and maintainer of [Antidot Framework](https://github.com/antidot-framework), PSR-15 Middleware-based PHP micro Framework made for learning purposes. Also, I'm a core team member at [Pheature Flags](https://github.com/pheature-flags) toggling library.

#### ðŸ”Œ Tech

I'm convinced PHP's [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/) advocate who is always learning, I like playing around with Async PHP.

I love reading tech books, attending events and meetups, and sometimes I write as [PHP-FAD](https://medium.com/php-fad) on Medium.
