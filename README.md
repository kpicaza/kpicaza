Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is **[Koldo Picaza]()**, I'm a self-taught PHP developer since 2011.

#### ðŸ’¾ Software

I work as a **backend developer** at [@drincs&co](https://github.com/uvinum), and I love **doing** and **contributing to Open Source** on my free time.

I'm the creator and maintainer of [Antidot Framework](https://github.com/antidot-framework), a PSR-15 Middleware-based PHP micro Framework made for learning purposes. Also, I'm a core team member at [Pheature Flags](https://github.com/pheature-flags) Feature toggling library.

#### ðŸ”Œ Tech

I'm convinced PHP's [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/) advocate which is always learning, I like playing around with Async PHP.

I love reading tech books, attending events and meetups, and Sometimes I write as [PHP-FAD](https://medium.com/php-fad) on Medium.
